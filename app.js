In Next.js 15, issues can arise with the new App Router when using dynamic routes and data fetching within a layout.  For example, if a layout fetches data based on a route parameter, and that parameter isn't available during the initial render (e.g., server-side rendering without the parameter), it might throw errors.  The solution involves carefully handling the loading state and conditional rendering based on data availability.
