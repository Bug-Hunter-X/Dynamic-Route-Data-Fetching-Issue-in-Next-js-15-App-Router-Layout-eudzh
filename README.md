This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using dynamic routes and data fetching within layouts in Next.js 15's App Router. The `app.js` file contains the buggy code, resulting in errors during server-side rendering and client-side navigation, and `appSolution.js` offers the corrected version.  The error stems from attempting to access route parameters before they are fully resolved during rendering. The solution involves using conditional rendering to handle the loading state effectively and gracefully.
