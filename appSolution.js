In the corrected version (`appSolution.js`), we introduce a loading state to handle the case where data is not yet available. We conditionally render content based on whether the data is loaded.  This prevents the application from attempting to access data before it's ready.  Additionally, error handling should be implemented to catch potential data fetching failures.
